# Atmosphere API Validation studies

This repository contains validation studies for the Atmosphere API available at https://amentum.space 

Each directory contains: 

- a README.md file containing a description of the study, summary of findings, and instructions to run the Python code and re-generate the results
- images or profiles comparing values of atmospheric density or temperature obtained using the Atmosphere API alongside experimental results or predictions of other models.

Feel free to add a validation study by creating a new branch and submitting a pull request. 

## Retrieving an API Key

You will need to register for an Amentum API Account [here](https://developer.amentum.io). Once you confirm your email, generate an API Key under the `Settings` page, then subscribe to the `jb2008` and `nrlmsise00` endpoints under the `Subscriptions` page. 

**Note** these studies perform a large number of API calls, so please be mindful of your quota. 

# Running the analyses

Follow instructions in the README.md files in the subdirectories.
